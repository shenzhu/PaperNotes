## Improvements
A user appears at a certain location, and leaves a post which is likely **semantically** related to the user and/or the location. User movements sometimes correlate if two users have similar lifestyle or living routine, and user interest affects user movement no at the **syntactic** level of 2-dimensional coordinates but at the **semantic** level of places with a certain function.

They propose a **spatial topic model**, called ST, that takes the correlation of users' movements, and the correlation of user movements and user interest into account. A location in this paper is defined as a place with **semantic functionality** and with its 2D coordinates, and each post is assigned to a **region and a topic**.

In this paper, they employ the **sparse coding technique** which greatly speeds up the learning process.
