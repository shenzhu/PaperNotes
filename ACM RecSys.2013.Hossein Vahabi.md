# Orthogonal Query Recommendation

## Keyword
***Algorithms***, ***Experimentation***, ***Measurement***

## Improvement
When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query recommendation comes to rescue, but traditional algorithms aim to provide queries that are, at least **syntactically similar to the original**.

In some cases, there is a highly ranked page relevant to the user's needs that appears in the result set of the **new query**, whereas the result set of the original query did **not** contain such results. Interestingly, in this case, the higher the query similarity used for the perturbation, the **less likely** that the recommendation would succeed. We seek queries that is **orthogonal**, which means that they have **no common terms**, but still **semantically similar**.

Orthogonal query recommendation is **complementary** to traditional query recommendation.

## Questions & Ideas
In this paper, the researchers seek **orthogonal queries**(queries that have no common terms with the user's query), but is it really the best case, is there a person coefficient value that makes the recommendation best when the queries reach it ?
