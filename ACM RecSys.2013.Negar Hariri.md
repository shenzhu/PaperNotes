## Improvement
Context aware recommender systems provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a **given situation or context**. And we define context as "any information that can be used to **characterize the situation of an entity**.

In this paper, researchers consider a typical setting in which contextual information is not pre-specified, but rather is obtained in the course of a user's **interaction** with the system. For a document recommendation, they use **words in the documents** as features. For music recommendation, popular **tags** are retrieved from social Web sites for all the songs and are used as songs features.

They propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates **user profile, item descriptions, and contextual information**.

## Questions & Ideas
This paper uses the interactive information between users and the system as contextual information for recommender system, we may adopt a dynamic method by using the **interactive information in a period**.
