# How to Read a Paper

## Keyword
***Paper***, ***Reading***, ***Hints***

## 1. Introduction
Researchers must read papers for several reasons: to **review them for a conference or a class**, to **keep current in their field**, or for a **literature survey** of a new field.

## 2. The Three-Pass Approach
The first pass gives you a **general idea** about the paper, the second pass lets you **grasp the paper's content**, but **not** its details. The third pass helps you **understand the paper in depth**.

### 2.1 The first pass
The first pass is a **quick scan** to get a **bird's-eye** view of the paper. Step:

1. Carefully read the **title, abstract, and introduction**.
2. Read the section and sub-section **headings**, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the **conclusions**.
4. Glance over the **references**, mentally ticking off the ones you've read.

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five ***Cs***:

1. **Category**: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. **Context**: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. **Correctness**: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. **Contributions**: What are the paperâ€™s main contributions?
5. **Clarity**: Is the paper well written?

When you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to **choose coherent section and sub-section titles** and to write **concise and comprehensive abstracts**. If a reviewer cannot understand the **gist after one pass**, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

### 2.2 The second pass
In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignores **details such as proofs**.

1. Look carefully at the **figures, diagrams and other illustrations** in the paper. Pay special attention to **graphs**. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with **error bars**, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
2. Remember to mark **relevant unread reference** for further reading(this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

Sometimes you won't understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. You can choose to:

1. set the paper **aside**, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career
2. return to the paper later, perhaps after reading **background material**
3. go on to third pass

### 2.3 The Third Pass
The key to the third pass is to attempt to **virtually re-implement** the paper: that is, making **the same assumptions** as the authors, re-create the work.

## 3. Doing a Literature Survey
What papers should you read? Here is how you can use the three-pass approach to help:

1. Firstly, use an academic search engine such as **Google Scholar** or **CiteSeer** and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five **recent papers** in the area.
2. In the second step, find shared **citations and repeated author names** in the bibliography. There are the key papers and researchers in that area. 
3. The third step is to go to the website for these **top conferences** and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey.
