# Big Data Benchmarking
---

## Keyword
***Big Data***, ***Benchmark***

## 1. Introduction
The development of benchmarks is a necessary step in helping **quantify system architectures** designed to confront this data deluge and tackle data applications.

For providing objective measures of the effectiveness of hardware and software system dealing with big data applications. The benchmarks would facilitate **evaluation** of **alternative solutions** and provide for comparisons among different solution approaches by **characterizing the new feature sets, enormous data sizes, large-scale and evolving system configuration, shifting loads, and heterogeneous technologies** of big-data and cloud platforms.

## 2. Workshop Description

## 3. Background
There was general consensus at the workshop that a big data benchmarking activity should begin at the **end-application level**, by attempting to characterize the **end-to-end needs** and **requirements of big data applications**.

It is important to model the **core set** of operations relevant to each genre while also looking for **similarities** across genres. 

There are good examples of successful benchmarks. If we want to extend the current benchmark to create a new big data benchmark, we need to consider:

- the existing benchmark models **relevant application scenarios**.
- the existing benchmark can be naturally and easily **scaled** to the **large volumes** that will be required for big data benchmarking.
- such benchamrks can be used more or less "as is", without requiring significant re-engineering to produce data and queries(operations) with the **right set** of characteristics for big data applications.
- the benchmark has **inherent restrictions or limitations**.


## 4. Conclusion
The workshop concluded that there was both a need and an opportunity to define benchmarks for big data applications. Such benchmarks would model **end-to-end** application scenarios and consider a **variety of costs**, including total system cost, setup cost, and energy costs. Benchmark metrics would include **performance metrics** as well as **cost metrics**.
